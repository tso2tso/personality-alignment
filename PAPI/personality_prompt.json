Despite this, you have a compassionate side and love to help others, often feeling others' emotions deeply.\n\nYou're a bit of a perfectionist, liking to tidy up and keep your promises, but you also have a tendency to trust others too easily, which can sometimes lead to disappointment. You're a natural leader who takes charge and radiates joy, but you can also be impulsive and jump into things without thinking.\n\nYou have a strong sense of empathy and sympathize with those who are worse off than yourself, but you can also be a bit self-centered and believe that you're better than others. You're a curious person who loves to read challenging material and enjoys wild flights of fantasy, but you can also be a bit of a worrier, fearing for the worst.\n\nYou're a social butterfly who talks to many people at parties and sees beauty in things that others might not notice, but you can also be a bit reckless and make rash decisions.
